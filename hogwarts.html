     <h1>Hogwarts</h1>
     Hogwarts was founded around 990 A.D. by four of the greatest wizards and witches 
     of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.
    They each represented an aspect of personality that they wanted to bring out in new students.
    Term begins every year on September 1, and finishes at the end of June the following year. Students
     have the option of staying at Hogwarts for the winter and spring holidays. Those who choose to stay 
     at the castle do not have lessons and attend a feast on Christmas Day.
