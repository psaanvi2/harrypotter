     <h1>Movies</h1>

    There are eight movies in the Harry Potter serize and all of them 
    are the same exept that the last book The Deathly Hallows is into 2 parts.
    They also had a very specail way they did the addition.There was no open 
    auditionâ€”they went all over England to find these characters, and not just
     drama schools. They came to my school and asked if they could put forward 
     a group of 20 children between the ages of 9 and 12.One of the hardest scense 
    was Oldman recently appeared on the Happy Sad Confused podcast hosted by Josh Horowitz,
     during which he revealed that his toughest scene to film as Sirius Black occurred in Harry
      Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, when his character lay prone beside a frozen lake as 
      Dementors sucked out his soul. An error occurred. You can watch these movies anywhere like
      the theater, at home on your T.V, or even watch a play.
